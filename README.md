# xps-peaks

This web application enables a lookup of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
peak positions in a plot as well as a table. The photon energy is selectable
which lets you quickly identify potential overlap of photoelectron and Auger
signals. You can try it out [here](https://matkrin.github.io/xps-peaks/). It
uses the lookup table from
[KherveFitting](https://github.com/gkerherve/KherveFitting).
